# Scoring Explanation

In our system, scores are presented in a more user-friendly format. Each score is represented as a percentage out of 100. For instance, a score of **0.56** translates to **56 out of 100**.

We use this scoring system to provide clarity and make it easier for users to understand their performance. Here are further insights:

- A score of **0.75** means **75 out of 100**.
- Scores encourage improvement and learning, allowing users to see just how close they are to perfection!

By converting fractional scores into percentages, we ensure that users can easily relate to the results, fostering a sense of achievement and motivation to improve.
